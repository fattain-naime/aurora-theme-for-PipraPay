== Description ==
Aurora Invoice brings the same visual system from the gateway checkout to generated invoices and payment links. It features a gradient hero, compact totals summary, secure call-to-actions, and a modern payment-link form that supports every custom field you add from the dashboard.

== Installation ==
Bundle this folder alongside `pp-content/themes/gateway/aurora` in the same ZIP and upload it through Appearance → Themes → Add New. The importer reads both `meta.json` files and places each theme under the correct directory, so activating “Aurora” switches both the checkout and invoice experiences together.

== Changelog ==
= 1.0.0 =
* Initial release.
